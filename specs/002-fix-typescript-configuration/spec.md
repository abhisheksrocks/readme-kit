# Feature Specification: Fix TypeScript Configuration Error

**Feature Branch**: `002-fix-typescript-configuration`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix TypeScript configuration error where rootDir conflicts with test files outside src directory"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: Scope of configuration files - Which configuration files should be modified to fix this issue? ‚Üí A: Only tsconfig.json (best practice for small projects: remove rootDir setting)
- Q: Verification enforcement - Should local type-checking be enforced or just recommended? ‚Üí A: Required in docs but not enforced (developers should check, CI catches issues)
- Q: Build output handling - Should test files be explicitly excluded from production build output? ‚Üí A: Yes, tests must be explicitly excluded to prevent compilation to dist/ after rootDir removal
- Q: Performance impact tolerance - What is the acceptable compilation time impact from this configuration change? ‚Üí A: No performance constraint
- Q: Rollback strategy - If the configuration change causes unexpected issues, what recovery approach should be used? ‚Üí A: Revert entire commit (rollback all changes)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the readme-kit project, I need the build system to successfully type-check both source code and test files so that I can develop and test features without type-checking errors blocking my workflow.

Currently, developers encounter 7 type-checking errors when running `npm run type-check` because the build configuration rejects test files located outside the source directory. This prevents developers from running type checks, using IDE features effectively, and maintaining code quality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a clean project checkout, **When** a developer runs `npm run type-check`, **Then** all source files and test files type-check successfully with zero TypeScript errors and exit code 0
2. **Given** a developer is working in VS Code or similar IDE, **When** they open any test file from tests/ directory, **Then** the IDE Problems panel displays no TS6059 errors and TypeScript IntelliSense works correctly
3. **Given** the project has tests located in tests/ directory (outside src/), **When** the build system runs `npm run type-check`, **Then** it type-checks both source and test files without TS6059 "file is not under rootDir" errors
4. **Given** a successful build via `npm run build`, **When** inspecting the dist/ directory, **Then** it contains only compiled source files (dist/infrastructure/, dist/shared/, dist/main.js) with no tests/ subdirectory or .test.* files present

### Edge Cases
- What happens when new test files are added to tests/ directory? The system must type-check them without requiring tsconfig.json modifications (type-checking ‚â† compilation to dist/).
- What happens when the project is cloned fresh and `npm run type-check` is run immediately? It must pass with zero errors without manual intervention.
- How does the system handle the separation of build artifacts from test files? Test files must be explicitly excluded from dist/ build output while remaining type-checked.
- What happens if the configuration change causes unexpected issues? The entire commit (tsconfig.json + CLAUDE.md changes) must be revertable as a single atomic unit to restore previous working state.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Build system MUST type-check all TypeScript files (both source and test files) without rootDir-related configuration errors (TS6059), validated via acceptance scenario AS-001
- **FR-002**: Build system MUST accept test files located outside the main source directory (tests/), and new test files added to tests/ directory after the initial configuration fix must be included in type-checking when `npm run type-check` is executed, without requiring tsconfig.json modifications (validated by creating temporary test file and verifying type-check detection)
- **FR-003**: Build system MUST maintain physical separation between source code (src/) and test code (tests/) while enabling type-checking of both
- **FR-004**: Build system MUST generate build output in dist/ directory that mirrors src/ structure (dist/infrastructure/, dist/shared/, dist/main.js) and excludes all test files from production build artifacts
- **FR-005**: Development tools (IDEs, language servers) MUST display no TypeScript configuration errors (specifically TS6059 "file is not under rootDir") for test files located in tests/ directory
- **FR-006**: All existing tests MUST continue to pass after configuration changes
- **FR-007**: Build configuration changes MUST be limited to tsconfig.json only (no modifications to vitest.config.ts, package.json, or other configuration files)
- **FR-008**: CI/CD pipeline (if configured) MUST validate successful type-checking across all source and test files
