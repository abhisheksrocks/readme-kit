# Feature Specification: Basic Health Check Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-basic-server`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "create basic server that would accept a GET request on /status endpoint and would returns everything is fine. Currently we don't have any database, or any other services that we will be interacting with. Use Fastify. Also, make the setup dockerizable so that the setup doesn't depend on the host system's environment/pakages installed."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What format should the /status endpoint response body use? ‚Üí A: JSON object with status field (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`)
- Q: What HTTP status code should a successful /status response return? ‚Üí A: 200 OK
- Q: What port should the server listen on for HTTP connections? ‚Üí A: Port 3000 (fixed)
- Q: Should the JSON response include additional metadata beyond the status field? ‚Üí A: Status field only (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`)
- Q: How should the /status endpoint respond to non-GET HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)? ‚Üí A: Return 405 Method Not Allowed
- Q: Should the server log incoming requests to the /status endpoint? ‚Üí A: No logging for /status requests
- Q: The /status endpoint should function as which type of health check? ‚Üí A: Liveness only (server is running)
- Q: Should the /status endpoint implement rate limiting or throttling for requests? ‚Üí A: No rate limiting (handle all requests)
- Q: How should the /status endpoint handle invalid query parameters or headers? ‚Üí A: Ignore them and return normal response
- Q: What value should the "status" field contain in the JSON response? ‚Üí A: "ok"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: HTTP server, health check endpoint, isolated environment
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: 200 OK status code]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: JSON object with status field "ok", no metadata]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Port 3000]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: No logging for /status requests]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: 405 Method Not Allowed for non-GET]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Liveness check only]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: No rate limiting]
   ‚Üí [RESOLVED: Ignore invalid params/headers]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: User flow determined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Requirements identified and clarified
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí SKIP: No data entities required
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: All clarifications resolved
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator or monitoring service, I need to perform a liveness check to verify the server is running by making a simple HTTP request that returns a success indicator, without validating external service dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request is sent to the /status endpoint, **Then** a JSON response with a "status" field is returned indicating the server is operational
2. **Given** the server is running in a containerized environment, **When** a GET request is sent to the /status endpoint, **Then** the JSON response is identical to a non-containerized deployment
3. **Given** the server receives multiple concurrent requests to /status, **When** processing these requests, **Then** all requests receive successful JSON responses without errors
4. **Given** the server is running, **When** a non-GET request (POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) is sent to the /status endpoint, **Then** the server returns HTTP status code 405 Method Not Allowed
5. **Given** the server is running, **When** a GET request with invalid query parameters or headers is sent to /status, **Then** the server ignores them and returns the normal 200 OK JSON response

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the /status endpoint receives a POST, PUT, DELETE, or other non-GET HTTP method? System returns 405 Method Not Allowed
- What happens if the server is under heavy load? System continues to handle all requests without rate limiting or throttling
- What happens when invalid query parameters or headers are sent to /status? System ignores them and returns normal response

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an HTTP endpoint at the path "/status" that responds to GET requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST return HTTP status code 405 Method Not Allowed when the /status endpoint receives non-GET HTTP methods
- **FR-003**: System MUST return HTTP status code 200 OK when the /status endpoint is accessed successfully with GET
- **FR-004**: System MUST return a JSON response body containing only a "status" field with the value "ok" (e.g., `{"status": "ok"}`)
- **FR-005**: System MUST run in a containerized environment that is independent of host system packages and environment
- **FR-006**: System MUST start successfully without requiring external services (databases, message queues, etc.)
- **FR-007**: System MUST listen for incoming HTTP connections on port 3000
- **FR-008**: System MUST NOT log incoming requests to the /status endpoint
- **FR-009**: System MUST respond to the /status endpoint as a liveness check only, without performing any external service checks or readiness validation
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle all incoming requests to /status without implementing rate limiting or throttling
- **FR-011**: System MUST ignore any query parameters or headers sent to the /status endpoint and return the normal response
